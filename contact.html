            Ashley has been more than willing to walk along side of Heartfelt
            Community, my new nonprofit. We have put our faith in her to build
            the website as she learns, and I have all the faith in her to
            complete what she started and continue to make our website shine as
            she gains more understanding in this field. Ashley has been a huge
            help in getting that area of service up and running. I would not
            have much of a website without her investment of time and
            willingness.

            I have known Ashley Riedell for quite some time, and she has proven
            to be a kind, caring, and compassionate young woman. Ashley is
            respectful of the people she encounters and demonstrates a great
            willing to work within the cultural norms of the people and
            communities she engages with.

            I can say without reservation that Ashley was a pleasure to work
            with, and she aquitted herself in the highest fashion as a leader of
            the group and someone who others sought for help and guidance. She
            was always well prepared for what we were doing every day, and she
            brought a level of both understanding and responsibility to the
            program which is rare.
